# Search Query

## Search

A search query consists of terms and operators. By default, the AND operator is utilized when constructing queries. Terms can be a single word or a phrase. A phrase is a group of words enclosed with double quotes.

Input your query in the searchbox, then press enter or the search button to start the search. Once you have a set of results, you can easily drill down by using the refiners on the left side of the screen or by clicking on various links in the result text.

## Fields

By default, all fields are searched. To limit your term to a field, type the field name followed by a colon **":"** and your term.

To get events from the SP2016WFE1 server, you would enter:

> **Server: SP2016WFE1**

Some useful fields:

* Server
* Level
* CorrelationID
* Source
* Category

Not all result types have the same fields. For a complete list of fields click [here](search-query.md#fields).

## Wildcard searches

Single and multiple character wildcard queries are supported. Use **"?"** for a single character wildcard and **"\*"** for a multiple character wildcard search.

Please note that searches with a starting wildcard are not supported. Use wildcard searches sparingly, they can be a performance killer.

## Operators

You can combine your terms using logical operators. The supported operators are **AND**, **OR**, **NOT** and **"-"**. Note that the operators must be **UPPERCASED**.

### AND operator

This is the default operator. The query: **database error** is equivalent to **database AND error**. Both terms must exist somewhere in the document. You can also use **&&** instead of the word AND.

### OR operator

Use this operator when you want to match multiple terms. **Server:Server1 OR Server:Server2** will return events from both Server1 and Server2. You can also use **\|\|** instead of the word OR.

### NOT operator

Used to exclude events from your search. **Level:Critical NOT administration** will return critical events that do not have the term administration. You can also use **!** instead of the word NOT.

Similar results can be achieved by using the – operator. **Level:critical – administration**.

## Clause grouping

Use parentheses to form subqueries. **\(Server:Server1 OR Server:Server2\) AND Level:Error** will return all events with Level equal to errors from both Server1 and Server2.

You can also write your queries in the following way **Server:\(Server1 OR Server2\)**

Clause grouping is recommended when writing queries with more than two clauses and different logical operators. Ie. instead of **test error OR Server:Server1** use the query: **\(test error\) OR Server:Server1**.

## Special characters

The following is a list of special character that are used in the query syntax.

+ - && \|\| ! \( \) {}\[ \] ^ " ~ \* ? : \

If you wish to use these characters in your terms, you must escape them with a \.

There are a couple of exceptions:

* If you are searching for a url, everything is escaped automatically.
* \ is escaped automatically.
* : is escaped automatically unless used to denote a field.

## Examples

**Example 1:** Query **Level:Critical database** will match events that contain the word "database" and that have a Level of Critical.&lt;/p&gt;

**Example 2:** Query **\(Level:Exception OR Level:Critical\) database** will match events that contain the word "database" and that have a Level of Critical or Exception.

**Example 3:** Query **Level:Critical "access the database"** will match events that have a Level of Critical and that contain the words "access" "the" "database" in the exact order.

**Example 4:** Query **Level:Critical admin\*** will match events that have a Level of Critical and contain a word that starts with "admin".

**Example 5:** Query **Level:Critical Server:Server1** will match events that occurred on Server1 with a Level of Critical.&lt;/p&gt;

**Example 6:** Query **Level:Critical AND Server:Server1**, same as example 5.

**Example 7:** Query **Level:Critical AND Server:Server1– database** will match events that occurred on Server1 with a Level of Critical that do not contain the word "database".

**Example 8:** Query **database AND NOT \(Level:Critical OR Level:Unexpected\)** will match events that contain the word "database" and not of a Level of Critical and are not of a Level of Unexpected.

**Example 9:** Query **SPUpdatedConcurrencyException Source:"SharePoint Server Search"** will match events that contain the word "SPUpdatedConcurrencyException" and have a source of SharePoint Server Search. Note the use of double quotations since the Source is comprised of multiple words.
