# Performance Counters

Here you can __manage the thresholds__ and the notification settings of every performance counter. They are divided into six categories or templates: General, IIS/ASP.NET, SQL, Disk, .NET and Search.
- __Raise alert__ for this counter - enable this if you wish to receive an alert when the counter reaches warning or critical threshold. Also, if any counter is either in critical or warning state, the entire server on __Performance tab__ will bi marked accordingly.
- __Thresholds__ - most of the counters have a predefined value. However, these values are not "one size fits all" so you can change them to suit your needs.
    - Enabling the Threshold checkboxes means that you will be alerted (Alerts tab in the application) when a given counter reaches its critical or warning limit. 

- Send to __default email__ address will send a notification (email) to addresses given in Settings -> Email Settings.
- Send to __alternate email__ address - here you can define extra emails of people that you wish to receive the notification. 

# Events

Opening the Events tab of Manage Alerts form will show you a list of all current Alerts as well as the time the alert was last sent on. 
To create a new alert click __New Alert:__
1. Enter the alert name.
1. Enter your search query choose if you wish to query only the ULS logs, Event or SQL logs. Naturally you can also search for every given type of log.
1. Filter by the farm and choose how often you wish to be notified.  
1. If you wish to be notified about the alert via email check the __Send to default email address__ checkbox. Also, you can send additional emails with selecting __Send to alternate email address__.  

If you want to edit an already existing alert navigate to aforementioned list of alerts and on the right hand side click the edit icon for a given alert.
